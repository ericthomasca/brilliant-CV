== 1. Introduction

Brilliant CV is a Typst template for making RÃ©sume, CV or Cover Letter inspired by the famous LaTeX CV template Awesome-CV.

== 2. Setup

=== Step 1: Install Fonts

In order to make Typst render correctly, you will have to install the required fonts #link("https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto")[Roboto]
and #link("https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+3")[Source Sans Pro] (or Source Sans 3) in your local system.

=== Step 2: Check Documentation

You are reading this documentation now, woah!

=== Step 3: Bootstrap Template

In your local system, just working like `git clone`, boostrap the template using this command:

```bash
typst init @preview/brilliant-cv:<version>
```

Replace the `<version>` with the latest or any releases (after 2.0.0).

=== Step 4: Compile Files

Adapt the `metadata.toml` to suit your needs, then `typst c cv.typ` to get your first CV!

=== Step 5: Go beyond

It is recommended to:

1. Use `git` to manage your project, as it helps trace your changes and version control your CV.
2. Use `typstyle` and `pre-commit` to help you format your CV.
3. Use `typos` to check typos in your CV if your main locale is English.
4. (Advanced) Use `LTex` in your favorite code editor to check grammars and get language suggestions.

== 3. Migration from `v1` to `v2`

With an existing CV project using the `v1` version of the template,
a migration is needed, including replacing some files / some content in certain files.

1. Delete `brilliant-CV` folder, `.gitmodules`. (Future package management will directly be managed by Typst)

2. Migrate all the config on `metadata.typ` by creating a new `metadata.toml`. Follow the example toml file in the repo,
it is rather straightforward to migrate.

3. For `cv.typ` and `letter.typ`, copy the new files from the repo, and adapt the modules you have in your project.

4. For the module files in `/modules_*` folders:

  a. Delete the old import `#import "../brilliant-CV/template.typ": *`, and replace it by the import statements in the new template files.

  b. Due to the Typst path handling mecanism, one cannot directly pass the path string to some functions anymore.
  This concerns, for example, the logo argument in cv-entry, but also on `cv-publication` as well. Some parameter names were changed,
  but most importantly, you should pass a function instead of a string (i.e. `image("logo.png")` instead of `"logo.png"`).
  Refer to new template files for reference.

  c. You might need to install `Roboto` and `Source Sans Pro` on your local system now,
  as new Typst package discourages including these large files.

  d. Run `typst c cv.typ` without passing the `font-path` flag. All should be good now, congrats!


Feel free to raise an issue for more assistance should you encounter a problem that you cannot solve on your own :)

== 4. Confuguration via `metadata.toml`

The `metadata.toml` file is the main configuration file for your CV. By changing the key-value pairs in the config file, you can
setup the names, contact information, and other details that will be displayed in your CV.

// TODO: think about ways to present the metadata.toml file in a more readable way, also to parse docstrings in the file.
